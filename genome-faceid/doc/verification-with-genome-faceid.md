# Verification of human by his 3d face model builded from his own DNA

In verification process take part at least two independed devices.

One device have ability to calculate face identifier from image or video stream.

Another device has abilities to get DNA of human, build 3d face model from this DNA, use result 3D face model to calculate its face identifier.

Any of the identifiers can be calculated in advance and stored on the device, or calculated each time anew in real time. This behavior is configurable.

For verification, both identifiers are transmitted to one of the devices or to a third, where they are compared.

The result of the comparison is the degree of similarity of the faces for which the identifiers are calculated, the verification requirements determine the threshold values, after which it is assumed that the identifiers points to one person or to different ones.
